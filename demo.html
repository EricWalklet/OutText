		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  Whoa there!</p>
        <p>[clop clop]</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Halt!  Who goes there?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Pull the other one!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  I am.  And this my trusty servant Eric. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court of Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  What, ridden on a horse?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  Yes!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  You're using coconuts!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  What?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Where'd you get the coconut?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  We found them.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  What do you mean?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Well, this is a temperate zone.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  Not at all, they could be carried.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  It could grip it by the husk!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  ...A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound coconut...</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  Please!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Am I right?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  I'm not interested!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #2:</span>  It could be carried by an African swallow!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow, that's my point.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #2:</span>  Oh, yeah, I agree with that...</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">ARTHUR:</span>  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  But then of course African swallows are not migratory.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #2:</span>  Oh, yeah...</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...</p>
		<p>[clop clop]</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #2:</span>  Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  No, they'd have to have it on a line.</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #2:</span>  Well, simple!  They'd just use a standard creeper!</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #1:</span>  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?</p>
		<p><span class="speaker">GUARD #2:</span>  Well, why not?</p>
